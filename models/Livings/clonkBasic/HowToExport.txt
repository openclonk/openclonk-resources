General information:
This is a modular clonk model that consists of rigged meshes. This should allow easy creation of new clonks, without having to tinker
with details such as animations, and so on. Create your clonk by joining the meshes and export it. The instructions below will tell
you what to do so that the clonk uses the animations of the original clonk.


How to export:
1. Adjust UVs as desired
2. Rename material "enter_material_name" to your desired material name
3. Join meshes under "armature" as desired
4. Delete the unnecessary meshes
5. a) If you want to create a new clonk:
      Rename the mesh datablock to "include.Clonk" => this is necessary so that it will use the skeleton "include.Clonk.skeleton" after the export
   b) If you want to create a skin for the original clonk:
      Rename the mesh datablock to "Clonk" => it should use the 
6. When using the exported mesh in one of your objects, use the "include.Clonk.skeleton" from this directory, because the exported skeleton may be broken
